    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an IT student at USIU currently pursuing a Masters in Information
      Systems technology. My degree background is in law hence this Master's
      degree is a learning experience for me. Have a look at some of the
      projects I have done for the past three months as I lay my foundation for
      hopefully, an illustrous career in IT.

      unit I took called Fundamentals of Programming

        This was a group project that tested our understanding of the various
        programming paradigms (procedural, oop and functional). I worked on the
        procedural.js from scratch. I also worked on functional.js by referring
        to
        https://github.com/academind/functional-procedural-oop/blob/functional/functional.js
        , a separate github repo, tweaking it to align with our code.
      </p>
      <p>Here is the problem/question we were solving:</p>
      <p>
        Develop a login application (See figure 1) that can validate both input
        fields
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The fields should not be empty on submission</li>
        <li>The username field should be a valid email address</li>
        <li>The password should be more than 8 characters</li>
        <li>Validation should employ three alternatives:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Functional,</li>
        <li>OOP,</li>
        <li>Procedural programming</li>
