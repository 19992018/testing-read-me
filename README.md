    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an IT student at USIU currently pursuing a Masters in Information
      Systems technology. My degree background is in law hence this Master's
      degree is a learning experience for me. Have a look at some of the
      projects I have done for the past three months as I lay my foundation for
      hopefully, an illustrous career in IT.
