      This portfolio contains all my fundamentals of programming projects and
      assignments The Fundamentals of Programming course taught the fundamentals
      of programming in various languages. Thus the projects in this repository
      are in different languages including: Javascript, Prolog et. al

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an IT student at USIU currently pursuing a Masters in Information
      Systems technology. My degree background is in law hence this Master's
      degree is a learning experience for me. Have a look at some of the
      projects I have done for the past three months as I lay my foundation for
      hopefully, an illustrous career in IT.
    </p>
    <h1>My projects</h1>
    <p>
      Click the links below to see how I approached the various assignments in a
      unit I took called Fundamentals of Programming
    </p>

      </li>
      <p>
        This was a group project that tested our understanding of the various
        programming paradigms (procedural, oop and functional). I worked on the
        procedural.js from scratch. I also worked on functional.js by referring
        to
        https://github.com/academind/functional-procedural-oop/blob/functional/functional.js
        , a separate github repo, tweaking it to align with our code.
      </p>
      <p>Here is the problem/question we were solving:</p>
      <p>
        Develop a login application (See figure 1) that can validate both input
        fields
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The fields should not be empty on submission</li>
        <li>The username field should be a valid email address</li>
        <li>The password should be more than 8 characters</li>
        <li>Validation should employ three alternatives:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Functional,</li>
          <li>OOP,</li>
          <li>Procedural programming</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>
        NB: LogIn Interface assignment was implemented in c++, Python and Java
        (not JavaScript as written in the commit message) That was just a minor
        error from my end. I promise I know the difference between Java and
        JavaScript.

          >Family Tree using Prolog (Week 3)</a
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        A program in PROLOG that is able to tell the relationship between family
        members based on data you have given the program. For instance, it can
        tell who are whose siblings, depending on whether they share parents.
        Test the program in swish.swi-prolog.org
      </p>
      <p>Here is the exact question or problem we were solving individually:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Build a knowledge base that includes facts and relationships about
          your family, extending to a minimum of four generations . The rules
          should include who are : siblings(); father(); mother();
        </li>
        <li>Implement it as a Family Tree in Prolog.</li>
        <li>
          The program should be able to answer queries such as: mother(X, Y);
          siblings(X,Y);
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/19992018/fundamentals-of-progamming-portfolio/tree/main/Area-%20in%20various%20programs"
          >Area of Shapes (Week 4)</a
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        This is a basic area of shapes program implemented in various languages.
        The major topic being tested was control-flow statements.
      </p>
      <p>See the exact question we were answering below:</p>
      <p>
        Write a program to calculate and display the area of a shape that the
        user defines via the keyboard.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The program should prompt the user to choose the shape, and then enter
          the required variables. For example, if a user chooses a circle shape,
          then the program should prompt for the radius. Once the user enter the
          radius, the program calculates and displays the area.
        </li>
        <li>
          The program should be implemented in any three programming languages
          of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>Do the screenshots of the code and results and upload.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/19992018/fundamentals-of-progamming-portfolio/blob/main/Grades%20program.py"
          >Grade Program (Week 5)</a
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        This program was particularly testing how much we understood loops. It
        was also testing whether we know how to use switch/match case statements
      </p>
      <p>Here is the exact problem we were solving:</p>
      <p>
        Develop a program that will take marks as input and award the
        appropriate grade based on USIU's grading system. Use all the necessary
        control statements The program should continue taking marks input from
        the user and display the appropriate grades, and terminate Only upon the
        user's command. (Hint: use loops).
